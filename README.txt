We honestly and politely suggesting that one test has to be done only by one
Developer. Consequently, we would like to emphasise that test will be followed
by technical interview where your knowledge will be checked and any cheating may
be uncovered during personal conversation which may lead to the to be wasted for
all.

Thank you very much for understanding! :)

Test is expected to be done with “Production ready” quality; therefore company
will have a chance to have best understanding about your professional level.

This functionality must be done as separate module that can be easily installed
on any Drupal 7 instance and ready to use 'from the box'.

Using Field API create new field type that will save Vimeo video.
User will copy/paste Video URL into this field in BO 
(e.g. http://vimeo.com/borisseewald/momentum orhttp://vimeo.com/67025679).
It needs to be saved as numeric video ID
(every video has ID in Vimeo, 67025679 in prev example) in database and showed
in front as video thumbnail (fetched from Vimeo site) with a link to this video
on Vimeo site. You must use widgets and formatters to interact with user and
present results.

Organize your code as module named ‘adyax_test’.
You should write your code respecting drupal standards and approaches.edited
